    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am working for [__Siemens AG Österreich__](https://new.siemens.com/at/de.html){:target="_blank"}, in the research department [Technology](https://new.siemens.com/de/de/unternehmen/innovationen/forschung-entwicklung.html){:target="_blank"}, in the research group __Configuration Technologies__. We develop configurators and related methods and tools for industrial and infrastructure domains, like railway safety systems or smart production systems.

      My research focus is on logic- and constraint-based knowledge-representation and reasoning techniques. My research position within Siemens is that of a __Senior Key Expert for Deductive and Constraint-Based Reasoning__.

experiences:
    - role: Information Scientist
      time: 1993 - Present
      company: Siemens AG Österreich
      details: |
        The main strategy of our research group is to do not only basic research in configuration and configuration-releated topics, but to to bring this research to operational readiness and implement it in customer projects for our Siemens internal sectors.
        
        Three aspects dominate my work experiences: 
        - As a research scientist, I am involved in both Siemens internal and nationally or EU funded research projects.
        - As a project manager, I lead small to medium-sized R&D projects within our research group. 
        - As a software architect and developer, I contribute to our R&D projects for our Siemens customers. By default, we use a software stack that is based on Java, SpringBoot and Angular on the frontend.
        
        My scientific background is symbolic AI, especially logic- and constraint-based knowledge-representation and reasoning to solve combinatorial problems, like configuration problems. Related topics are optimization, model-based engineering, or business process management.

    title: Projects
    intro: |
      During my time at Siemens, I've worked on a wide variety of projects, many of them in the area of configuration and related topics. The areas of application were for industry and infrastructure.
      
      Two of the main areas are:
      - Railway safety systems: The main challenges in rail applications lie in the safety requirements and, on the other hand, in the complexity and long service life of the products. Our engineering tools support project engineers in configuring their systems in a highly automated and verified manner.
      - Smart production: Flexible production planning is especially important when producing products with small lot sizes. The so-called producibility check checks whether and how a new product can be manufactured in a factory. The results are optimized production plans.
